  <h2> General Ingredients </h1>
  Beer in general is made of four main ingredients and those are: grain, hops,<br>
  yeast and water. There are roughly two main types of beer which are normal “plain” beer<br>   
 and craft beer. Craft beer is considered more tasteful than normal beer such as the ones you<br>
  see in the store like Miller lite, Michelob Ultra and Bud light. These “normal” <br>
  beers typically all taste the same because they use pretty much only use the main<br>
  four ingredients. The difference between these normal beers is how much of the<br>
  main four ingredients there are. Another difference is the alcohol percentage.<br>
  Craft beer is typically having a higher alcohol percentage than normal beers.<br>
  Craft beers also add extra ingredients such as different hops (which could be<br>
  sour, fruity or even bitter). Craft beers such as stouts (darker beers) might<br>
  even use different types of yeast or malt such as chocolate malt. <br>
  <h3> Ingredients Copyright </h3>
  Now that general ingredients have been discussed, its now time to talk about copyright. <br> 
  The craft beer world has a lot of similar beers being made year round. The biggest <br> 
  thing that brewers need to know is how copyright of ingredients work. If a beer is brewed <br> 
  by a brewery, that brewery may not in any case patent the ingredients. However, the brewery <br> 
  can apply to patent the way that specific ingredients was prepared. This means if they brewed an<br> 
  IPA (Indian Pale Ale) and they used the four core ingredients and an extra fuit hops totaling the <br> 
  ingredients to five, the brewery may patent the way they prepared those five ingredients. <br> 
  This means if another brewery wants to brew that beer and prepare it the same way, they must<br> 
  give credit to the brewery that patented that beer.
