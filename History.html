   <h2> The history of craft beer </h2> 
   Craft beer arose in the United states sometime in the 1960's. THis came<br> 
   about because homebrewing became popular around this same time so people <br> 
   Started experimenting. Microbreweries became popular in the 90's and the rest <br> 
   is history as you can find many breweries in each state and sometimes even each county.<br> 
   <h3> History of patents </h3> 
   Over the years, brewers started to profit off of their beer but there were issued with copright<br> 
   Brewers were finding people would copy a beer perfectly and sell it as thier own, so in the 90's <br> 
   the national brewers associated started creating beer patent laws. This is a recurring process as their <br> 
   are still laws being produced today with the most recent major law being introduced in 2019.<br> 
   These laws outline basically what can be patented and what cant. It regulates so no single brewer can <br> 
   patent a major ingredients of beer. It allows for the fairness of all brewers but allows brewers to profit<br> 
   off of thier original creations.
